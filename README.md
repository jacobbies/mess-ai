# README: Training a Deep Expressive Embedding Model

## **Objective**
The goal of this step is to train a deep learning model that can learn **expressive music embeddings** for **timestamped retrieval**. This model will focus on capturing musical expressiveness, including **rubato, phrasing, articulation, dynamics, and timbre**, allowing users to find musically similar passages based on content rather than metadata.

---

## **Approach**
Instead of training a contrastive model from scratch, this step follows a **two-phase training approach**:

1. **Self-Supervised Pretraining**
   - Train a model (e.g., **Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, OpenL3, or a DBN-based model**) on a large classical music dataset to learn **general musical representations**.
   - This step enables the model to **understand music structure, timbre, and phrasing without labeled data**.

2. **Contrastive Fine-Tuning for Expressiveness**
   - Fine-tune the pretrained model on a labeled dataset with **expressive similarity pairs**.
   - Use **contrastive or triplet loss** to ensure that similar expressive passages are **clustered together in embedding space**.

---

## **Key Features of the Model**
- **Captures Expressive Similarity**: Trained to recognize expressive elements such as rubato, articulation, and phrasing.
- **Segment-Level Retrieval**: Instead of classifying entire tracks, the model learns to find **specific timestamped passages**.
- **Pretraining + Fine-Tuning Pipeline**: Uses **self-supervised learning** first, then specializes in expressiveness.
- **Vectorized Search (FAISS)**: Stores expressive embeddings for **efficient retrieval of musically similar segments**.

---

## **Planned Workflow**
### **1️⃣ Dataset Preparation**
- Collect **large-scale classical music recordings** (e.g., **MAESTRO, MusicNet, IMSLP**).
- For pretraining: Use **raw, unlabeled recordings**.
- For fine-tuning: Create **positive/negative expressive similarity pairs**.

### **2️⃣ Pretrain a Deep Music Model (Self-Supervised Learning)**
- Select a **self-supervised model**: Options include **Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, OpenL3, or DBNs**.
- Train the model on **raw music audio** to extract deep musical features.

### **3️⃣ Fine-Tune Using Contrastive Learning**
- Use **contrastive or triplet loss** to optimize the model for expressive similarity.
- Train on expressive **positive/negative music segment pairs**.

### **4️⃣ Store Embeddings & Build Retrieval System**
- Store **expressive embeddings** in **FAISS** for efficient **timestamped similarity search**.
- Evaluate retrieval quality using **cosine similarity, Mean Average Precision (mAP), and triplet loss**.

---

## **Next Steps**
1. **Choose the best pretrained model for expressive feature extraction.**
2. **Prepare a dataset with expressive similarity pairs.**
3. **Fine-tune the model using contrastive learning.**
4. **Integrate FAISS for similarity search.**

---

## **Expected Outcome**
- A trained model that can retrieve **expressively similar passages** based on a given musical input.
- Improved accuracy in finding **timestamped segments** that share expressive characteristics.
- A more efficient and scalable **music retrieval system** compared to purely metadata-based approaches.
