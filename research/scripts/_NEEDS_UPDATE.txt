The following research scripts need to be updated to work with the simplified search module:

- build_layer_indices.py (uses old LayerIndexBuilder)
- demo_layer_search.py (uses old LayerIndexBuilder)
- evaluate_layer_indices.py (uses old LayerIndexBuilder)
- evaluate_similarity.py (uses old FAISSIndex and SimilarityComputer)

These scripts were experimental and not validated. They can be:
1. Updated to use the new simple search.py module
2. Deleted if not needed
3. Rewritten for specific research experiments

The main demo script (demo_recommendations.py) has been updated to work with the new module.
