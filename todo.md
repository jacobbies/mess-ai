# MESS-AI Enhancement Roadmap

Based on MERT research analysis and current system capabilities, here are the next steps for enhancing search/recommendation functionality.

## Current Status âœ…
- **MERT Feature Extraction**: Complete with MPS acceleration (2.6min processing)
- **FAISS Similarity Search**: Sub-millisecond queries with 99%+ accuracy
- **Full Stack Integration**: React frontend + FastAPI backend working perfectly
- **50 Classical Tracks**: Complete metadata and waveform visualization
- **Production Ready**: All core functionality operational

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. **Adaptive Similarity Metrics** ðŸŽ¯ (High Impact)
**Current**: Fixed cosine similarity  
**Enhancement**: Train lightweight model on MERT embeddings to predict human similarity ratings

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Create Siamese network architecture for similarity learning
- [ ] Collect/generate human similarity rating dataset for classical music
- [ ] Fine-tune similarity metric to better align with human perception
- [ ] Extend `src/mess_ai/search/similarity.py` with learned metrics
- [ ] Add configurable similarity weighting (rhythm vs harmony vs timbre)

**Expected Benefits**: More perceptually accurate recommendations, user-aligned similarity

### 2. **Task-Specific Domain Adaptation** ðŸŽ¼ (Medium Impact)
**Current**: General MERT embeddings  
**Enhancement**: Fine-tune MERT specifically for classical music domain

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Set up MERT fine-tuning pipeline for SMD dataset
- [ ] Create classical music-specific training objectives
- [ ] Fine-tune on composer style, era, and musical form recognition
- [ ] Evaluate improved classical sub-genre distinction
- [ ] Compare before/after similarity quality on classical pieces

**Expected Benefits**: Better understanding of classical music nuances, improved sub-genre distinction

---

### 3. **Hierarchical Song Structure Analysis** ðŸ“Š (Medium Impact)
**Current**: 5-second MERT segments averaged  
**Enhancement**: Implement hierarchical model to capture song development over time

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Design sequence model architecture over MERT embeddings
- [ ] Implement temporal attention mechanism for song structure
- [ ] Create embeddings that encode intro/buildup/climax patterns
- [ ] Add song section similarity (match songs with similar developments)
- [ ] Extend `src/mess_ai/models/` with hierarchical components

**Expected Benefits**: Distinguish songs with different narrative structures, structural similarity matching

---

### 4. **Multi-Modal Enhancement** ðŸ”— (Long-term)
**Current**: Audio-only similarity  
**Enhancement**: Integrate metadata, composer information, and musical era context

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Create text embeddings for composer biographies and musical analysis
- [ ] Design multi-modal fusion architecture (audio + text + metadata)
- [ ] Implement joint embedding space for audio and contextual information
- [ ] Add lyrical content analysis (for vocal pieces)
- [ ] Create unified similarity that combines musical and contextual similarity

**Expected Benefits**: Richer similarity understanding, context-aware recommendations

---

### 5. **User Feedback Integration** ðŸ‘¤ (Long-term)
**Enhancement**: Implement feedback loop to learn user preferences

**Implementation Plan**:
- [ ] Add user interaction tracking (likes, skips, play duration)
- [ ] Implement preference learning algorithms
- [ ] Create personalized similarity metrics per user
- [ ] Add collaborative filtering layer on top of content-based MERT similarity
- [ ] Build user profile embeddings and recommendation personalization

**Expected Benefits**: Personalized recommendations, adaptive user preference learning

2. **Context-Aware Search** 
   - [ ] Use metadata to filter/boost recommendations by era, composer, form
   - [ ] Add "find similar within same composer" mode
   - [ ] Implement "cross-era similarity" discovery

3. **Advanced FAISS Indices**
   - [ ] Experiment with IVF indices for larger datasets
   - [ ] Test HNSW for approximate nearest neighbor search
   - [ ] Benchmark performance improvements

4. **Similarity Explanation**
   - [ ] Show why tracks are similar (rhythm, harmony, timbre breakdown)
   - [ ] Add visual similarity explanation in frontend
   - [ ] Implement feature importance visualization

5. **Enhanced Frontend Features**
   - [ ] Add similarity sliders for different musical aspects
   - [ ] Implement playlist generation from similarity chains
